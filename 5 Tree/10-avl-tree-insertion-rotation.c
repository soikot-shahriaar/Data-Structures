/* Understanding the Code:
1. At first, create a struct Node. Inside the structure, we would have four embedded elements, first is an integer variable data to store the data of the node, second is a struct Node pointer called left to store the address of the left child node, and third is again a struct Node pointer called right to store the address of the right child node. Fourth is an integer variable storing the height of that node for the ease of calculating the absolute balance factor. Absolute balance factor, if we remember, should not exceed 1, otherwise, that node becomes imbalanced.

2. Create an integer getHeight, and pass the pointer to the struct node we want to get the height of as the only parameter. Check if the struct node pointer is not NULL, return 0 if it is NULL, otherwise return the height element of the struct node. And that would be it.

3. Create a struct Node* function createNode, and pass the data/key for the node as the only parameter. Create a struct Node pointer node.  Reserve a memory in the heap for the node using malloc. Make the left and the right element of the struct node point to NULL, and fill the data in the data element. Now, set the height element of this node as 1, because any new node would be a leaf node that has a height of 1. And now, return the pointer node we created. This would simply create a node as a part of the tree. 

4. Create a struct Node* function getBalanceFactor, and pass the pointer to the struct node we want to get the balance factor of as the only parameter. Now the balance factor of a node is just the value we receive after subtracting the height of the right child with that of the left child of the node. So, first check whether the node is not NULL, if it is, simply returns 0. Otherwise, return the value received after subtracting the height of the right child with that of the left child. This was a utility function to find the balance factor for a node.

5. Create a struct Node* function leftRotate, and pass the pointer to the imbalanced struct node we want to left rotate as the only parameter. Consider this node x as represented in the figure above.  As we could see, the left child of x is y. So, define a struct node pointer variable y and initialize it with x->right. As seen in the figure, we would make x the left child of x, and T2 the right child of x. So, we would also store y->left in another struct node pointer variable T2. 
Now, simply assign x to the left element of y, and T2 to the right element of x. And this would finish our left rotation function. We must, however, remember to change the new heights of the nodes that have been shifted, which are x and y. Height of x becomes one added to the maximum of the heights of both of its children. Similarly, the height of y becomes one added to the maximum of the heights of both of its children. And now simply return y, since y becomes the new root for the subtree. Donâ€™t forget to explicitly define a max function before using it.

6. Create a struct Node* function rightRotate, and pass the pointer to the imbalanced struct node we want to right rotate as the only parameter. Consider this node y as represented in the figure above.  As we could see, the left child of y is x. So, define a struct node pointer variable x and initialize it with y->left. As seen in the figure, we would make y the right child of x, and T2 the left child of y. So, we would also store x->right in another struct node pointer variable T2. 
Now, simply assign y to the right element of x, and T2 to the left element of y. And this would finish our right rotation function. In addition, we must remember to adjust the new height for the nodes that have been shifted, which are x and y. Height of x becomes one added to the maximum of the heights of both of its children. Similarly, the height of y becomes one added to the maximum of the heights of both of its children. And now simply return x, since x becomes the new root for the subtree.

7. Create a struct Node* function insert, and pass the pointer to the root of the AVL tree and the data we want to insert as two of its parameters. Now, we would follow the simple Binary Search Tree insertion operation which we had already covered in our past lectures. There, we would just recursively iterate to the best-fit position where the new data should be inserted, and once found, we create a new node, and return the pointer to this node. 
And since we have recursively gone down the tree, we would backtrack after inserting. While backtracking, we update the heights of all the nodes we followed to reach the apt position. 
Once this new node gets inserted, the balance of the tree might get disturbed, so we would first create an integer variable bf, and store in it the balance factor of the current node we are on while backtracking. And if this node gets imbalanced, four of the possible cases arise. 
Left-Left case: 
Here, the new node would have been inserted on the left to the left child of the current node. So, if our bf has a value greater than 1, and the new node has data less than the data of the left child of the node itself, it is the case of left-left rotation, and hence we call the rightRotate function once to fix this disturbance. 
Right-Right case: 
Here, the new node would have been inserted on the right to the right child of the current node. So, if our bf has a value less than -1, and the new node has data greater than the data of the right child of the node itself, it is the case of right-right rotation, and hence we call the leftRotate function once to fix this disturbance. 
Left-Right case: 
Here, the new node would have been inserted on the right to the left child of the current node. So, if our bf has a value greater than 1, and the new node has data greater than the data of the left child of the node itself, it is the case of left-right rotation, and hence we call first the leftRotate function passing the left subtree and then call the rightRotate function on this updated node to fix this disturbance.
Right-Left case: 
Here, the new node would have been inserted on the left to the right child of the current node. So, if our bf has a value less than -1, and the new node has data less than the data of the right child of the node itself, it is the case of right-left rotation, and hence we call first the rightRotate function passing the right subtree and then call the leftRotate function on this updated node to fix this disturbance. 
And then finally return this node. 

8. The Last step would be to fetch the preOrder traversal function from our previous programming lecture, to actually see how our tree would get all balanced after all the insertions we would do.
