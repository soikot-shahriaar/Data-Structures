# Data Structures and Algorithms 

A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in C, featuring both fundamental concepts and real-world project applications.

## 📊 Data Structures

- **Array** - ADT, insertion, deletion operations
- **Linked List** - Creation, traversal, insertion, deletion, circular, doubly linked
- **Stack** - Array/LL implementation, parenthesis matching, infix-to-postfix
- **Queue** - Array/LL implementation, circular queue
- **Tree** - Binary tree, BST, AVL tree, traversals
- **Graph** - BFS, DFS implementations

## 🚀 Projects

### Real-World Management Systems

1. **Train Station Management** - Platform allocation/deallocation using linked lists
2. **Library Book Management** - Book borrowing/returning system
3. **Hospital Room Management** - Patient admission/discharge with room transfers
