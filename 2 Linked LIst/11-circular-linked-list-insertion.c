/*
Inserting into a Circular Linked List:

Create a struct Node* function insertAtFirst which will return the pointer to the new head.

Weâ€™ll pass the current head pointer and the data to insert at the beginning, in the function.

Create a new struct Node* pointer ptr, and assign it a new memory location in the heap. This is our new node pointer.

Create another struct node * pointer p pointing to the next of the head. p = head-> next.

Run a while loop until the p pointer reaches the end element and p-> next becomes the head.

Now, assign ptr to the next of p, i.e.p->next  = ptr. And head to  the next of ptr, i.e. ptr->next = head.

Now, the new head becomes ptr. head = ptr.

Return head.
