/*
Deleting the element with a given value from the linked list :

Here, we already have a value that needs to be deleted from the list. The main thing is that weâ€™ll delete only the first occurrence.

Create a struct Node* function deleteByValue which will return the pointer to the head.

Pass into this function the head node, the value which needs to be deleted.

Create a new struct Node* pointer p pointing to the head.

Create another struct Node* pointer q pointing to the next of head.

Run a while loop until the pointer q encounters the given value or the list finishes.

If it encounters the value, delete that node by making p point the next node, skipping the node q. And free q from memory.

And if the list just finishes, it means there was no such value in the list. Continue without doing anything.

Return head.
